        <h2 class="who-is-text">Who is Charmander?</h2>
        <p class="who-is-text">Charmander (/ˈtʃɑːrmændər/), known as Hitokage (ヒトカゲ) in Japan, is a Pokémon species in Nintendo's and Game
            Freak's Pokémon franchise. Created by Atsuko Nishida,[1] Charmander first appeared in the video games
            Pokémon Red and Blue and subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff titles, and
            various movies, animated and printed adaptations of the franchise. The end of a Charmander's tail is alight
            with a flame, and the flame's size reflects both the physical health and the emotions of the individual. It
            is known as the Lizard Pokemon.</p>

        <p>Gaming the player can choose from at the beginning of Pokémon Red and Blue, and their remakes, Pokémon
            FireRed
            and LeafGreen. In the anime, Ash acquires a Charmander early in the series, and it became one of his most
            used
            Pokémon. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather Professor Oak.
            Since
            it appeared in the Pokémon series, Charmander has received generally positive reception. Charmander first
            appeared in episode 11 of Pokémon Indigo League ("Charmander – The Stray Pokémon" (The Stray Pokémon –
            Hitokage)). In the episode, Charmander is left by its owner, Damian, and is rescued by Ash and Brock. When
            Damian sees how powerful Charmander is, he calls Charmander back. However, because of Damian's abuse,
            Charmander
            chooses to follow the group that saved its life, and becomes Ash's Pokémon. In the series, the narrator
            stated
            that if a Charmander's tail flame goes out, it dies. Charmander is used by Ash throughout his adventures and
            is
            seen in special episodes in the future.</p>

        <p>Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16, who then evolves into Charizard at level 36, which was originally its last form. Since the release of Pokémon X and Y, Charizard can mega evolve into 2 different types of Mega Charizard, which are Mega Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y, for the duration of a battle. This gives it temporary upgraded stats and a damage bonus. Charmander made the cut and in 2019 returned in Pokémon Sword and Shield.</p>
